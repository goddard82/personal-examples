# holidayBot

This flask application handles the GET/POST/PUT requests of the holiday-bot api, which is used to receive callbacks from an external HR API & send reminders to Slack.

To run locally:
Open a terminal & navigate to the folder containing the files then run `docker-compose build && docker-compose up` to start the service.
